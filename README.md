# Skeleton.scss

Skeleton.scss is a modified, unofficial SASS port of the Skeleton CSS framework authored by Dave Gamache.


## Version

2.0.4


## Installation

To install Skeleton.scss via Bower:

```sh
$ bower install skeleton.scss
```


## Using Normalize.css (or not)

Skeleton leverages the illustrious Normalize.css for element resets. It is configured by default to utilize this file via an `@import` statement. If you do not wish to use `normalize.css`, simply comment out its importing in the beginning of `skeleton.scss`.


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
