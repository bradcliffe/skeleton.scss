// Media Queries
// ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

/// Note: The best way to structure the use of media queries is to create the
/// queries near the relevant code using the 'respond-to' mixin. For example,
/// if you wanted to change the styles for buttons on small devices, you would
/// include the 'respond-to' mixin with the 'bp-small' argument and write the
/// desired properties for the declaration block.
///
/// The more conventional method of handling media queries would be to insert
/// the following query blocks around the desired rules, but that kinda takes
/// the fun and utility out of SASS.

@import '../settings';

// Larger than mobile
@media (min-width: $bp-extra-small) {}

// Larger than phablet (also point when grid becomes active)
@media (min-width: $bp-small) {}

// Larger than tablet
@media (min-width: $bp-medium) {}

// Larger than desktop
@media (min-width: $bp-large) {}

// Larger than Desktop HD
@media (min-width: $bp-extra-large) {}
